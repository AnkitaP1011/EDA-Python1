This project analyzes a dataset of 10,000 movies from The Movie Database (TMDB), containing details such as titles, cast, directors, popularity, budgets, revenues, and genres. The objective is to explore trends in movie revenues and determine which genres have been most popular over the years. Using Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, we clean, process, and visualize the data to answer key questions about movie success factors. The analysis aims to provide insights into what drives higher revenues and genre popularity in films.
